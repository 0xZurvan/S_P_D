# S-P-D: State Psychopath Detector.
Welcome to Cornell the most secure city in the world. The city is under the control of the S-P-D system, a super secure AI system that determines the psychological state of all the citizens to eradicate any possible criminal psychos. This autonomous system was created by the government. Lately, inspectors have discovered some murder cases that need to be solved. Who committed those crimes, is the S-P-D system reliable, can the inspectors and citizens trust it and it is really autonomous?
